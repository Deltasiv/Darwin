# History 

The history of Darwin started out when one developer by the name of Nico wanted to make a program to
help with his Microbiology interests. Then after a bit of tinkering two other programmers joined him Johannes and Hydra. 
After a bit of talks we settled on Darwin and decided to make Darwin a Microbiological tool that anyone can use.
